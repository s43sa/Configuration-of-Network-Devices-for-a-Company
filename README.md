# Configuration-of-Network-Devices-for-a-Company
The project's objective is to configure the complete network infrastructure for a new company. This project aims to integrate the various routing and switching concepts into a single real-world project.

Phase 1:
-Cable a network according to the topology diagram.

-Configure the main network devices: Switch and Router.

-Configure VLANs on all switches.

-Configure a router to support 802.1q trunking on the Ethernet interface.

-Configure a router with subinterfaces for the configured VLANs and inter-VLAN routing.

Phase 2:
-Configure the link aggregation with EtherChannel.

-Explain how LAN attacks compromise LAN security.
-Configure switch security techniques to mitigate LAN attacks.
-Configure dynamic routing protocols: Single-Area OSPFv2.
